# üó£Ô∏è Virtual Butler with Speech Recognition

This Python script introduces a virtual butler capable of speech recognition, providing a hands-free interaction experience. The butler can perform tasks like playing music, telling the current time, and sharing random jokes.

## üöÄ Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Communicate with the butler using speech commands.
- **Music Playback**: Ask the butler to play your favorite music on YouTube.
- **Time Information**: Inquire about the current time with a simple command.
- **Humor Included**: Get a dose of humor by asking for a random joke.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Make sure to install the required libraries and modules using the following commands:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install PyAudio
pip install pywhatkit
```

## üéôÔ∏è Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## ü§ñ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The butler initializes and welcomes the user.

2. **Command Recognition**: It listens for a command using the microphone.

3. **Trigger Detection**: If the trigger word "pappu" is detected, it processes the command.

4. **Command Execution**:

   - Commands like "play" trigger music playback.
   - "time" fetches the current time.
   - "fact" gets a random joke.

5. **Communication**: The butler communicates through both the console and text-to-speech, providing a seamless user experience.

Feel free to explore the code for more details on how each functionality is implemented.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Overview

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import pywhatkit
import datetime
import pyjokes

listener = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say("Welcome Sir! I am here to help.")
engine.say("Please say your command!")
engine.runAndWait()

def talk(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

def butler_command():
    try:
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            print("Listening ....")
            voice = listener.listen(source)
            command = listener.recognize_google(voice)
            command = command.lower()
            if "pappu" in command:
                command = command.replace("pappu", "")
                print(command)  # The result in the terminal
    except:
        pass
    return command

def run_butler():
    command = butler_command()
    print(command)
    if "play" in command:
        song = command.replace("play", "")
        talk("Playing " + song)
        pywhatkit.playonyt(song)
    elif "time" in command:
        time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M")
        print(time)
        talk("Current time " + time)
    elif "fact" in command:
        talk(pyjokes.get_joke())

run_butler()
```
